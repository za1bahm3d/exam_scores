Student Exam Performance Dashboard

Overview

This project analyzes student exam performance in Math, Reading, and Writing, focusing on key factors such as gender, parental education, socioeconomic status, and test preparation. The insights help identify trends and disparities in student outcomes.

Dataset

The dataset includes student scores across three subjects along with demographic and socioeconomic factors:

Gender

Parental Education Level

Lunch Type (Standard vs. Free/Reduced)

Test Preparation Course Completion

Key Insights

Gender Differences: Female students perform better in Reading and Writing, while males slightly outperform in Math.

Parental Education: Higher parental education correlates with better scores across all subjects.

Lunch Type Impact: Students with standard lunch score higher, suggesting financial stability impacts learning.

Test Preparation: Completing a prep course significantly improves performance, particularly for disadvantaged students.

Correlations: Strong positive relationships exist between Math, Reading, and Writing scores, indicating overall academic consistency.

Visual Breakdown

The dashboard consists of:

Overview Metrics: Displays average exam scores for Math, Reading, and Writing.

Correlation Analysis: Scatter plots showing relationships between subject scores.

Gender Influence: Comparison of male vs. female performance across subjects.

Socioeconomic Impact: Examines lunch type, parental education, and their effect on scores.

Test Preparation Analysis: Evaluates the effectiveness of test prep courses.

Next Steps for Further Analysis:

Investigate ethnic disparities in test prep participation and performance.

Analyze gender & parental education interactions for deeper insights.

Explore additional socioeconomic indicators, such as school funding or parental occupation.


Conclusion

Parental education, financial stability, and test preparation significantly impact student success. Addressing these gaps through targeted interventions, such as better access to test prep and academic support, could help bridge performance disparities.
